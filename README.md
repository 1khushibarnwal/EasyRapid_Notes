EasyRapid Notes is a full-stack note-taking web application built with React (frontend) and Express + MongoDB (backend). It enables users to create, organize, and manage notes seamlessly in a clean, responsive interface.

With TailwindCSS + DaisyUI powering the design, Axios for API requests, and Upstash Redis rate limiting for backend security, the project balances modern UI/UX with robust performance.

📝 CRUD functionality for notes

🎨 Responsive, modern UI with TailwindCSS + DaisyUI

⚡ REST API built on Express + MongoDB
